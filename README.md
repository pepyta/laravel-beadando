# Introduction

This project was made for Server-side Programming course at Eötvös Loránd University.

# Requirements

- PHP 8.2.12
- Composer 2.6.5

You can use other versions of these softwares, but these are tested and guaranteed to work.

# Setting up

Run the following command to set up an instance of the project.

```bash
./init.sh
```

> [!TIP]
> On Windows, you can copy those commands and run it directly from your terminal.

# Running

The initial setup script also starts a development server, but if you want to start the server again, without resetting anything you can run this command:

```bash
php artisan serve
```
